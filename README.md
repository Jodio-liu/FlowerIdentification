# FlowerIdentification
## Overview
A Convolutioal Neural Network to identify flowers is created. The network is based on a pre-trained model within the Tensorflow framework. 

To fine-tune the existing weights, images of the [PlantCLEF dataset](http://www.imageclef.org/lifeclef/2017/plant) will be used.
